    <p>This project involves designing and coding an experimental clock that offers a novel way of tracking time. Moving beyond conventional units like seconds, minutes, and hours, we were encouraged to consider alternative ways of marking the passage of time. The clock reflects subjective, personal, and even unconventional methods of timekeeping. Thus, I decided to show this through animations of day and night.</p>
